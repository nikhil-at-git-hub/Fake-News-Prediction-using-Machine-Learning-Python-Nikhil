# Fake-News-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Python-Nikhil
This project intends to build a machine learning system that predicts whether a news article is fake or real where 0 denotes that the news is real and 1 signifies that the news is fake.

This is a machine learning model based on Logistic regression that aims to predict whether a news article is fake or real.
A .ipynb file has been attached for refernce which contains all the code along with outputs along with comments for proper understanding.
Dataset used: Fake news prediction from Kaggle(also attached in repository)
IDE : Jupyter Notebook


Logistic regression is genarraly used when the output is a binary classification. Such as TRUE or False, YES or NO, FAKE or REAL etc.
Logistic regression is used when the variables in thw dataset are categorical and the out is a binary classification.
