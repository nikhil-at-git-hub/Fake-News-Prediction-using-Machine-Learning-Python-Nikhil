# Fake-News-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Python-Nikhil
This project intends to build a machine learning system that predicts whether a news article is fake or real where 0 denotes that the news is real and 1 signifies that the news is fake.

This is a machine learning model based on Logistic regression that aims to predict whether a news article is fake or real.
A .ipynb file has been attached for refernce which contains all the code along with outputs.
Dataset used: Fake news prediction from Kaggle(also attached in repository)
IDE : Jupyter Notebook
